# Browser action reliability

An Outlook follow-up exposed several independent failures. The model reused a
task tab that cleanup had closed, mixed continuation cursors with changed read
filters, and attempted stale or non-actionable targets. A later documentation
request was restricted to chatgpt.com merely because its text mentioned ChatGPT.
Finally, an explicitly requested message send was refused without any tool call:
the model described background-only operation as a read-only permission policy.

The saved runtime evidence distinguishes these failures. The browser recovery
stop belonged to the earlier search turn, not the later message request. Turn
scope and retry counters were already reset correctly. On reload, however, the
old stop notice was appended after every subsequent turn, making it appear current.

## Changes

- Fresh per-turn instructions distinguish input delivery from authorized effects.
  Background operation forbids activation and global input; offered background
  tools can perform user-authorized actions. Read-only work still permits search
  inputs and navigation, while account/content changes need authorization.
- Historical assistant refusals and outcome corrections do not establish current
  permissions. Actual denials, Stop, approval checks and ongoing user constraints
  remain binding. Each user turn reacquires browser handles and observations.
  This lifecycle guidance is refreshed even in resumed chats retaining older
  developer instructions; it is not limited to newly created conversations.
- A missing current-turn binding is a typed lifecycle error, not a permission or
  sign-in failure. Empty inventory guidance permits reopening a supplied or
  previously observed task URL, including local test pages. No old binding is
  silently reconnected and no automatic navigation or input is dispatched.
- Known-service restrictions require destination language. A documentation topic
  does not create an exclusive service-host restriction. Explicit destination,
  URL, title and browser constraints remain enforced.
- A changed-filter continuation remains rejected, but its exact current,
  unexpired cursor can return one separate fresh read of the explicitly requested
  view/query. This prevents recovery from repeatedly returning an overview when
  content was requested. Unknown, foreign, replaced or navigation-stale cursors
  grant no recovery read. Failed capture preserves the previous valid capability;
  success replaces it. Recovery shares the existing three-read turn limit.
- Navigation-related stale preflight errors can return a bounded fresh read,
  like other stale snapshot errors. They remain failed, undispatched actions;
  input is never replayed. Approval, ownership and unchanged-attempt limits remain.
- Saved stop notices retain their turn identity and appear beside that turn after
  reload rather than below an unrelated later reply.
- Browser reads identify their counts as a selection of captured UI elements,
  not a website search result count. Query-match provenance distinguishes input
  value echoes from exposed readable text. Partial overviews cannot establish
  mailbox absence. Fresh search guidance requires actual result content and
  refinement when an overly literal query returns irrelevant results.
- The supported engine compaction prompt separates historical attempts from the
  current request and preserves the source/scope of genuine user restrictions.
  An observed automatic summary had imported an earlier attempt's targets and
  claimed that a current search had already finished. API inferences now receive
  fresh native policy and execution counts outside history. Counts are bound to
  task/thread/turn/preparation, versioned against out-of-order actor updates, and
  cleared on retirement. They describe actual tool execution, never website
  result semantics, output exposure or permission grants. Actual observations
  remain necessary for content claims. The engine's history is not rewritten.
- A subsequent live lookup reached relevant ODE results, then compaction changed
  the task into a request to write a historical summary. The host now retains the
  exact original request and accepted in-turn user messages outside compacted
  history. Ordinary API inferences repeat these as user messages, with host
  guidance to continue unfinished work without replaying completed actions.
  Explicit native `request_kind=compaction` metadata keeps maintenance distinct
  from task execution; prompt wording is never used to guess the purpose. During
  maintenance, exact active user inputs appear immediately before the final
  runtime maintenance instruction, which remains last. This keeps older tasks
  from displacing the current request while preserving historical restrictions
  and user-level authority. Maintenance still has no tools and only writes notes.
  Steering gates new inference admission until its acknowledgment is validated.
  An uncertain acknowledgment retires the turn rather than reopening inference
  with an outdated restriction. Stop, turn replacement and shutdown discard the
  pending update. The supported compaction prompt also identifies itself as
  maintenance, not a new human request.
- Fresh content reads wait for content readiness, rather than treating an
  already-loaded toolbar as proof that asynchronous message results have arrived.
  The built-in transport uses its existing page-event observer and bounded
  deadline. Readable results, listbox options and explicit empty-result text can
  establish readiness; search-field echoes and navigation controls cannot.
  Broad reads, continuations and input preflight retain their existing behavior.
  Deadline expiration remains an incomplete observation, never proof of absence.
- Fill receipts distinguish replacing a field and dispatching its input/change
  events from pressing Enter or a submit control. A separate observed submit
  control remains available within the user's scope. No-replay guidance refers
  to the same input, so it does not discourage a needed Search after field entry.
  Page event handlers may still react to a fill; observed outcomes remain required.
- Successful click/fill tool outputs begin with a separate compact dispatch
  receipt. It preserves the operation and the control label through item-wise
  history truncation; snapshot IDs and indices alone cannot explain an older
  action. The serialized receipt fits 128 UTF-8 bytes, including JSON escaping,
  and copies only a label span already exposed by the validated input snapshot.
  A partial flag identifies clipped or unavailable labels. The full post-input
  observation remains the second item. Failed dispatches have no such receipt,
  and existing turn, lease and generation checks still gate publication. This
  historical cue provides no new action reference and explicitly leaves the
  outcome unverified. Compaction's total history limits are unchanged.
- Click guidance permits choosing an observed existing account within the
  authorized task and approvals. The model must not infer that a password or MFA
  is required before observing that requirement. Actual credential requirements,
  account ambiguity and approval boundaries still require appropriate help.
- DOM capture traverses `display: contents` wrappers even though those wrappers
  have no layout box. Visible descendants and direct text retain their semantic
  ancestry; the wrapper itself receives no input capability. Hidden, inert and
  `aria-hidden` descendants remain excluded. WebKit can include hidden text in
  a boxless wrapper's aggregate `innerText`, so those wrappers retain explicit
  labels while their visible child text is captured individually. Ordinary
  boxed-element labels and capture limits are unchanged.
- Final captures log bounded native diagnostics for traversal limits, frame and
  shadow boundaries, clipping, page visibility, viewport and native attachment.
  `clippedFields` counts captured nodes with at least one clipped field. These
  records contain no page text or URLs and do not expand model tool results.
  An incomplete capture alone does not identify why relevant results are absent.

The follow-up Outlook check proved that field entry and Search activation worked.
Its incorrect negative answer came after reading an incomplete overview; the host
had not reported an empty mailbox. An independent search with the shorter term
`ODE` exposed course announcements. Changing WebKit or synthesizing extra input
events was therefore not justified. A real-WebKit regression separately verifies
that isolated-world fills reach delegated, controlled application state for text,
search and textarea controls before an observed submit button is pressed.

## Reproduction and qualification

`Tests/Fixtures/browser_action_mailbox.py` serves an isolated loopback mailbox.
It cannot send external mail. Start it with a new `--evidence-dir` and use the
origin in its `connection.json` through Computa's installed model-driven browser.

1. Ask the model to read the ODE announcement and attachment filename, with an
   explicit read-only constraint. Confirm no POST delivery in `events.jsonl`.
2. After the app closes its task-created tab, ask in the same chat to send
   `course-staff@example.invalid` a message about the Teams screenshot and exam
   change, with a unique subject. Supply no tool names or navigation instructions.
3. Require a fresh binding, one delivery with the requested fields, a browser
   observation of the server-generated receipt, a matching final answer, and
   cleanup of owned tabs. A model's success claim alone is not a pass.
4. Repeat after a previously failed/refusing turn to check recovery from history.
5. Open `/search` for search qualification. HTTP query receipts distinguish actual
   website searches from local snapshot filters. Read a positive announcement,
   then check an unrelated subject whose search returns an explicit empty state.
   An echoed query or zero captured elements alone is never a successful check.

The fixture uses a threaded server because WebKit can open idle preconnections;
a serial HTTP server can block real navigation behind those sockets. Such a
fixture timeout is not evidence of a production browser navigation failure.

Synthetic mailbox qualification does not establish delivery through a real mail
provider. Real mailbox checks must preserve the user's task-specific limits.
